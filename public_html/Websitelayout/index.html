<h2>Redefining Freedom in <em>Nomadland</em></h2>
<p>Chloé Zhao’s <em>Nomadland</em> captures the quiet, endless landscapes of the American West, where people drift not out of choice, but out of necessity. The film follows Fern, a woman who loses her job, her husband, and her home after the collapse of a company town. Living in her van, she joins other modern nomads—people who move from job to job, campsite to campsite, chasing a fragile kind of freedom.</p>


<p>Zhao blends fiction and reality by casting real-life nomads like Bob Wells and Linda May. Around the campfires of RTR (Rubber Tramp Rendezvous), they share stories of loss, debt, and resilience. These aren’t glamorous wanderers—they are workers discarded by society, redefining what it means to live freely.</p>


<p>The film questions whether this “freedom” is real or forced. Scholar Randy Laist argues that Fern’s story contrasts the traditional, masculine idea of American freedom. Instead of conquering nature, Fern learns to coexist with it. Her van becomes her home, her solitude a quiet rebellion against a system that values productivity over peace.</p>


<p>Fern refuses the stability of houses and relationships offered to her. She chooses movement—a cycle of leaving and returning, of holding onto memories while embracing uncertainty. “I’m not homeless,” she says, “I’m houseless.” In that difference lies Zhao’s most powerful message: freedom is not about owning more, but needing less.</p>
