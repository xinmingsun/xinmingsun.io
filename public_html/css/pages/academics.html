	<p>My major is Media, Culture and Communication. I will take 5 course this semester, including Introduction to Web Design. My favorite study site in campus is the first floor in Bobst. Beside this, I love studying in quiet Cafe ☕️ off-campus. My favorite Cafe is called "THUMA" in Soho, which is actually a Furniture Store. Here's a picture of me studying there with my friend.</p>
