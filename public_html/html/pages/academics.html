	<p>I am a Sophmore from <a href="https://www.nyu.edu/">NYU</a>. My major is Media, Culture and Communication. I will take 5 course this semester, including Introduction to Web Design. My favorite study site in campus is first floor in Bobst. Beside this, I love studying in quiet Cafe off-campus. My favorite Cafe is called "THUMA" in Soho, which is actually a Furniture Store. Here's a picture of me studying there with my friend.</p>
